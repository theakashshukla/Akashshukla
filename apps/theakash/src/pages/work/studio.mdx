One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## System

| Name       | Detail                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| OS         | Windows 11 Home 64-bit       |
| Proccessor | Intel Core i3-6th Gen        |
| RAM        | 12GB DDR4                    |
| GPU        | 500MB                        |
| Storage    | 1.5TB                        |

This computer may not have the latest specs, but it runs incredibly fast and smooth! It's perfect for web development, even for larger or heavier projects.

## Display

The dual monitor setup maximizes my web development workflow. I can code on one screen while previewing live on the other â€” no more <span class="text-xs"><Kbd>Alt</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd></span> necessary for faster, more efficient work!

Need a website with extra wide breakpoint? I've got you covered with my ultrawide monitor.
